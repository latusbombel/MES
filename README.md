# Overview
This repository contains implementations of the Finite Element Method (MES) applied to physical problems. The projects focus on building numerical solvers from scratch, from mesh generation to solving the resulting systems of equations. 
# Technical Stack
C++: Core numerical engine and matrix assembly.

Gauss-Legendre: Custom quadrature implementation for numerical integration.

Python: Post-processing and data visualization (Matplotlib).
